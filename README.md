A BRIEF OF THE PROTOTYPE:Using Flutterflow:
       User Interface (UI) Design:
Designed the app’s user interface, including screens for registration, login, and 
the main AR experience.
      User Registration and Login:
Included functionality for users to create accounts and log in.
      Search and Browse Features:
Implemented a search function for users to find destinations, hotels, restaurants, 
and attractions.
Included a filter and sorting system for search results.
       Destination Details:
Create detailed destination pages with information about popular spots, historical sites and local culture.
                                               Using GOOGLE MAPS:
API used are :
API for Android
API for iOS
Javascript API
                                              GOOGLE MAPS:
To use Google Maps, We to enabled the Maps SDK for Android and iOS in the 
Google Cloud Console. We also needed an API key, which will use to 
authenticate our app.We Followed Google’s documentation to obtain our API key. 
In our Flutterflow app, we created a screen or widget for the map. We Initialized 
Google Maps using our API key and display it in this widget.
                                              BLENDER:
We Used Blender to design and create 3D models, animations, textures, and 
other assets that we want to incorporate into our AR travel app. These assets can 
include 3D representations of landmarks, buildings, objects, or any other elements relevant to our travel app.

             FUTURE SCOPE:

Enhanced Navigation: AR can provide real-time, interactive maps and directions overlaid on the user's view of the physical world. This can make navigating new destinations easier and more intuitive.

Local Discovery: Travelers can use AR to discover local points of interest, historical sites, restaurants, and other attractions by simply pointing their smartphone or AR glasses at a location.

Language Translation: AR can help travelers overcome language barriers by providing instant translation of signs, menus, and spoken words.

Virtual Tour Guides: Travel apps with AR can offer virtual tour guides that provide information about landmarks and historical sites as users explore them.

Immersive Travel Previews: Before booking a trip, users can virtually explore their destination, hotels, and attractions to get a better sense of what to expect.

Interactive Travel Planning: Users can plan their itineraries by virtually arranging visits to attractions and restaurants, and getting a feel for how much time they need at each place.

User-Generated Content: Travelers can share their AR-enhanced travel experiences through social media, contributing to a more interactive and engaging travel community.

AR-Based Gamification: Gamified elements, like scavenger hunts or challenges tied to location-based AR, can make travel more fun and engaging.

Booking Integration: Integration with travel booking platforms can allow users to book flights, accommodations, and activities directly from the AR app.

Accessibility and Inclusivity: AR can be used to improve the travel experience for individuals with disabilities by providing information about accessible facilities and routes.

Safety and Emergency Information: Travel apps can provide real-time safety information, emergency contact details, and evacuation routes using AR.

Environmental Impact: Travel apps with AR can educate users about the environmental impact of their choices, such as carbon emissions and sustainable travel options.

Event Planning: For business travelers or tourists attending events, AR can provide real-time schedules, venue maps, and event-related information.

Cultural and Historical Preservation: AR can aid in the preservation and promotion of cultural and historical sites by providing immersive and interactive experiences.

The adoption of AR in travel apps will depend on technological advancements, the availability of AR-capable devices, and user acceptance. As AR hardware becomes more widespread and user-friendly, the potential for innovative travel experiences using augmented reality will continue to grow. Additionally, as the travel industry recovers from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, AR can play a crucial role in rejuvenating and reshaping the sector.
